// in java the first time code will be run in 
/* Global Execution Context

anoter contxt is functional context

eval execution context 
// the code will run in two phases

first will be memory creation phase (creation phase)
-> the memory ill be allocated to varaibles
execution phase
-> code will execute

1. Global execution this will be refrenced to global execution context
2. Memory phase ->the varaibles will be created
initial the value is not assigned 
they will be given undefined

3. Execution phase
// in this value will be assigned to variables 

if a fucntion is called then another execution context is formed 
// a new variable environment and executiion thread will be created

// new executional context will be created when the fucntion is called

// the vlue will be returned to global executional context

// the new executional context will be deleted when the function is terminated

the two phases will be again executed
